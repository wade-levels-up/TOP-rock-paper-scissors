# TOP-rock-paper-scissors

The Odin Project excercise / project
Create a rock paper scissors game using JavaScript.

Taken from this link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

For this project I will be creating a rock paper scissors
game played solely in the console. I will use an HTML file
that links to an external JavaScript file.

Additionally I would like to use Jest to run test cases as I build out the code, as well as practicing pseudocode before putting down any actual code.

I will make commits to my Github repository throughout.
